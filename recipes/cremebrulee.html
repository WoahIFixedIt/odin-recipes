    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>While crème brûlée seems like a fancy and difficult dessert, it’s actually pretty easy to make. In fact, you only need four 
        ingredients to make this recipe: egg yolks, sugar, heavy whipping cream, and some vanilla extract. That’s it! </p>

    <p>This recipe makes four servings, but you can easily cut it in half to just make two. And if you don’t 
        have a small torch to caramelize the sugar on the top of this dessert, I’m also sharing how to broil it in your oven.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small pot, heat cream over medium heat until hot but not boiling — small bubbles will appear just along the edge of the pot.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk together egg yolks, ⅓ cup sugar, and vanilla — I like to do this in a large glass measuring cup for easy pouring!</li>
        <li>When the cream is hot, add it to the egg yolk mixture a little at a time, whisking well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Pour into 4, 7-8 ounce ramekins, (wider and shallower is better if you have them).</li>
        <li>Place filled ramekins in a large baking dish and fill the baking dish with hot water so that it comes ¾ of the way up the sides of the ramekins. Be careful not to get any water in the custard!</li>
        <li>Bake at 325 degrees F for 30-45 minutes. This will depend on how deep the custard is! (Smaller ramekins, deeper custard = longer bake time) The top will appear set but underneath it will still jiggle.</li>

        <li>Cool to room temperature and then refrigerate for at least 2 hours until chilled. (You can wrap and refrigerate up to 3 days).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle each custard with 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and torch or broil just until caramelized. Serve immediately or chill to serve later.</li>
        

    </ol>
